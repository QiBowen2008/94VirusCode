bookmng 0.12

Bookmng is a small program that generates, from netscape bookmarks file,
several html files that contains all the bookmarks in a hierarchical
structure. The program is intended to enable you to easily publish
your bookmarks, while supporting: (i) convenient hierarchical
structure, with each page containing only several links (ii) linking
from the outside into your bookmarks, and (iii) hiding parts of the
bookmarks that are private,

Bookmng is currently very primitive. To use - compile (by doing 'make')
and edit bookmng.cfg. To run, do:

          ./bookmng bookmng.cfg

This is it.

To see how the output of bookmng looks like, have a look at:
