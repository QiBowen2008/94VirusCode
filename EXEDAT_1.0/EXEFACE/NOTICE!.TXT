
Notice that you can't run 'example.exe' just after compiling 'example.c'.
You first have to connect the 'test.res' file at the end of 'example.exe'.
To do this: copy 'example.exe' to the connect directory, and also copy the
'data\test.res' to this directory.
Then use:
  CONNECT example.exe test.res

After this, you can run example.exe
