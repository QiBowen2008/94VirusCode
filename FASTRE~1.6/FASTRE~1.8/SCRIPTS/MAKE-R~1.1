.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B make-report
resolves the IP addresses in the given log files and looks up the
owners of the resulting hosts' domains.  Then it runs Analog to create
a report, called report.html by default.
The log files are expected to be in the Common Log Format,
with optional referer and user-agent fields allowed at the ends of the
lines.
