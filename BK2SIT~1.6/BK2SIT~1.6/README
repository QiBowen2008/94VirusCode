Programmer's guide: (classes are in "quotes")

bk2site.C
The main(). Reads and parses the .bk2siterc files.

reference.C
The bookmarks are converted into a "referenTree" object. A referenceTree 
contains a vector of "reference". A reference object is either a url
(leaf) or a folder (non-leaf). references that are folders have a
pointer (children) to a referenceTree which contains all their
children.

element.C
An "element" represents one of the begin--end blocks found in the base
files. A "fileview" contains all the elements in some base file. A
fileview object is given some channels and other vector<reference> and 
can output the html file.

Its the model-view-controller pattern:
referenceTree is the model.
fileview is the view
no controller.

iwebstream.C 
Is given an url and provides a single interface for reading from
it. Handles files and http. It also does some SGML-type-tag parsing.

channel.C
A "channel" simply stores the parsed channel file, its a
vector<reference>. A "channelContainer" has a vector<channel>.
