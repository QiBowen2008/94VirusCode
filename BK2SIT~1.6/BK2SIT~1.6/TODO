- Add a %LINKTO(url) which turns into a link to where the url is
  on the local website. Add a datamember "localURL", and make a 
  new createsiteH() which simply sets these member values. (Change
  fixAlias??)

- redirect.pl and bk2site should handle directories.
    make redirect.pl change relative paths to absolute before saving.
    add a %CURL which gives the current directory (??).

1- Reads the user's bookmarks and displays them ala yahoo. Look will
not be customizable.

their bookmarks to a central (or chosen) website. Also, allow agent to
